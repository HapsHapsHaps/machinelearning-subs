# How to prepare and label a dataset to train on (WIP)

For this part you need to use the fantastic cool called Labellmg.
You can find it on Github here: 
[https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg)

I've included the compiled linux binary that I've been using in the `tools` folder.
Just unpack it and run the 'labelImg' file.
