# How to download and setup a premade dataset (WIP)
Luckily for you and me, there's a freely available dataset that can be used to test this object-detection guide with.  
**Remeber that this part is only needed if you don't already have your own dataset to test with.**

So lets use the use the freely available dataset `dataset name` at `dataset url`.

##### Download the dataset (WIP)
Execute the following command, to download the data set:  

[](`curl -LO http://download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz`)

##### Unpack the dataset (WIP)
`tar xzf flower_photos.tgz`  
This should give you a folder called `flower_photos`, with five different folders inside, each with a bunch of images of said flower.

##### final task for downloaded dataset (WIP)
Something..  

With the dataset now downloaded and prepared so it fits the self created dataset, we can now continue with the guide.
